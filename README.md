# Hi there üëã

I am Henri Vainio, self taught programmer now studying computer science in [Tampere University Finland](https://www.tuni.fi/en). 

I like to develop backend code especially with C#. 

## A Little Background

I started my programming career back in 2021. I wanted to ease my upper secondary school math studies by automating moving data between my Latex math editor and calculator. Back then I didn't have any experience in coding which meant I had to learn everything while writing the [app](https://github.com/henrivain/Matikkaeditorinkaantaja). This project with many others has thaught me a lot about software development. 

Alhough coding was very hard at first, it grew to a nearly daily habit for me. I started my programming career with python but quickly switched to C#. I found C#'s strongly typing very powerful and haven't switched away from C# after that. 

I thrive to improve myself every day and try to find the best recorces to learn the best practises. Trial and error has been a big part of my learning curve. Sometimes different coding styles seem great at first, but after trying them you see the pros and cons clearer. I think it's sometimes better to learn the hard way than someone just telling the right answer. 

I am currently studying computer science at the University of Tampere. University will certainly give me even broader perspective on computer science. I have also chosen to study mathematics as my minor, because a lot of the programming topics are based on mathematical concepts. 

## Technologies I like to use
`.NET` `C#` `ASP.NET Core` `.NET MAUI` `WPF` `XAML` `SQLite` `Python` `VsCode` `VS`

### .NET And C#

C# is clearly my favorite programming language. I find it's versatile feature set very flexible and fun to use.

#### WPF

WPF is UI framework used to develop Windows applications with C# and XAML. My first project uses WPF (after I switched from python to C#).   

#### .NET MAUI

.NET MAUI is UI framework designed to publish application for multiple OS platforms in only one single project. MAUI uses XAML and C# for its code.  

#### ASP.NET Core

APS.NET Core is a web framework that enables .NET developers to develop powerful APIs and web services with C#. I am currently developing a project for my student organization (see projects below) which contains a ASP.NET Core Web API with RESTful architechture. The API is currently all written by me. 

### Python

Even though most of my projects now use C#, sometimes it is just the best decision to go with something little more flexible and light. I started my programming career with Python and still use it when I don't need the same robustness of C#'s strong typing.  

### SQLite 

Nearly every application needs databases. Multiple of my applications use SQLite as their database system. With C# I almost always use Dapper ORM with my object mapping.

## Here are couple of my projects picks üî≠

### L√§rp√§ke

`APS.NET Core` `REST` `API` `Controllers` `SQLite` `Dapper ORM` `JWT` `Web`

[L√§rp√§ke](https://github.com/henrivain/Larpake) is project for my subject association Luuppi. L√§rp√§ke is next generation electronical freshman attendance card (Fuksipassi). It tracks who attends the most subject association events during their freshman year. L√§rp√§ke will be implemented as REST api (written by me) + web UI application using ASP.NET Core 9 API with controller architechture. The REST api uses SQLite with Dapper as its database system and Json Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.

### Tesseract Ocr Maui

`.NET MAUI` `Multiplatform` `P/Invoke` `Library` `Nuget`

[TesseractOcrMaui](https://github.com/henrivain/TesseractOcrMaui) is .NET wrapper around [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) optical character recognition library. TesseractOcrMaui is available as a Nuget package on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/TesseractOcrMaui/) and targets .NET MAUI Windows, Android and iOS. Native library interoperability is accomplish using P/Invoke.

### Matikkaeditorink√§√§nt√§j√§ & Latex2Compute

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e31ca91-b278-4c84-b6aa-09e62106906d" width="300" align="right"> 

`.NET` `Class Library` `.NET Framework` `.NET Core` `WPF` `XAML` `C#` `XUnit`

[Matikkaeditorink√§√§nt√§j√§](https://github.com/henrivain/Matikkaeditorinkaantaja) is my first project ever. The project was originally built in .NET framework 4.8 but then upgraded to .NET Core 5 onwards. Matikkaeditorink√§√§nt√§j√§ is a WPF application that converts mathematical Latex code to calculator readable form using my [Latex2Compute](https://github.com/henrivain/Latex2Compute) class libary. Latex2Compute is unit tested using XUnit testing library.
