## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Henri Vainio, originally self taught programmer now studying computer science in Tampere University Finland. 

### My History

I started my programming hobby back in 2021. I wanted to ease my upper secondary school math studies by automating moving data between my Latex math editor and calculator. Back then I didn't have any experience in coding which meant I had to learn everything while developing my first project "[MatikkaeditorinkÃ¤Ã¤ntÃ¤jÃ¤](https://github.com/henrivain/Matikkaeditorinkaantaja)". This project, with many others, has thaught me what to do and no to do when developing software. 

Alhough coding was very hard at first, I totally fell in love with it. Coding grew to a nearly daily habit for me. I started my programming career with python but quickly switched to C#. I found C#'s strongly typing very powerful and haven't switch away from C# after that. I really like .NET ecosystem because there is always something new and interesting and the C# language is improving itself day by day.

I thrive to make my code as readable as possible. For that reason I always try to improve myself and try to find the best recorces for learning the best practises. Trial and error has been a big part of my learning curve. Sometimes different architechtures and coding styles seem great at first, but after trying them you see the pros and cons clearer. I think it's sometimes better to learn the hard way than someone just telling the right answer. 

For my love of programming, I am currently studying computer science at the University of Tampere. University will certainly give me even broader perspective on computer science. I have also chosen to study mathematics as my minor, because a lot of the programming topics are based on mathematical concepts. 

## Technologies I like to use
`.NET` `.NET Core` `C#` `ASP.NET Core` `.NET MAUI` `WPF` `XAML` `SQLite` `VsCode` `VS`

### .NET And C#

C# is clearly my favorite programming language. I find it's versatile feature set very flexible and easy to use.

#### WPF

WPF is UI framework that has been developed from the early days of .NET framework to this day. WPF is used to develop Windows applications with C# and XAML. My first project now uses WPF after I switched from python to C#.   

#### .NET MAUI

.NET MAUI is UI framework designed to be used to publish application for multiple OS platforms in only one single project. MAUI uses XAML and C# for its code.  

#### ASP.NET Core

APS.NET Core is a web framework that enables .NET developers to develop powerful APIs and web services with C#. I am currently developing a project for my student organization (see projects below). The project contains a ASP.NET Core Web API with RESTful architechture. The API is currently all written by me. 

### Python

Even though most of my projects now use C#, sometimes it is just the best decision to go with something little more flexible and light. I started my programming career with Python and still use it when I don't need the same robustness of C#'s strong typing.  

### SQLite 

Nearly every application needs databases. Multiple of my applications use SQLite as their database system. With C# I almost always use Dapper ORM with my object mapping.  

## Here are couple of my projects

Coming soon...
